#Hi

#Hello my name is hayato

#new branch that I added after branching

#so this sentense is not affecting anything to the master branch




#hey I am in newBranch right now, so lets write something.
I guess this is pretty cool feature to be able to keep track of changes that I make to the code, but first I need to be used to use this system, to be able to use it with my actual projects, otherwise its gonna mess up both.
so this line is branching, a.k.a kind of experimenting sentenses so , it should not affect main branch until I am 100 % sure that this works and i want to add this change to the master branch. anyway, I will push this change , so first I type like "git add." this add all the file in the stage, like manaita. and if I commit, everything in this stage area will be pushed to the track.lets try by typing "git commit -m "add long sentense to the new branch"
